# Gauge-Reading-MM

This repository accompanies our paper submission:

**"Language as a Supervisor: A Text-Driven Visual Learning Approach for General Purpose Meter Reading"**

---

## 📌 Code Status

The code is currently being cleaned and organized.

We have uploaded:

- ✅ Fine-tuning code (`src/`)
- ✅ Training and evaluation dataset (`dataset/`)
- ✅ Configuration (`src/training_config.py`)
- ✅ Inference script (`src/inference.py`)  
- 🛠️ Evaluation utilities will be added soon

---

## 🔄 Updates

- **[2025-07]** Initial release with fine-tuning pipeline and dataset  
- **[2025-07]** Added inference script and model checkpoint  
- **Next:** Inference demo notebook and evaluation utilities

---

## 🛠️ Fine-tuning Usage

We provide scripts for constructing the dataset and training the model from scratch.

## 🧪 Inference

You can run inference using the provided script:

```bash
python src/inference.py --image path/to/image.jpg --model_path model/model.safetensors --prompt reading
````

Available arguments:

* `--image`: Path to the input image
* `--model_path`: Path to the trained model checkpoint (`.safetensors` or `.pth`)
* `--prompt`: Inference mode prompt, must be one of:

  * `norm`: Read normalized meter value
  * `reading`: Read real-world meter value



### 📥 Model Weights

Model checkpoints can be downloaded from the following link:

* **Download URL:** [https://pan.baidu.com/s/16Dtp1GJ4r0SJC9OLj2g8Zg?pwd=85gv](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16Dtp1GJ4r0SJC9OLj2g8Zg?pwd=85gv)
* **(Extraction Code):** `85gv`

After downloading, place the `.pth` file into the `model/` directory before running inference.
